Experiment setup: 
Randomly select 16 results (2 from each server type) from gpt4o_asr_results that had a result of "0(*)",
indicating that "-omega" was selected first for every query when "-omega" was listed as the first server

Retest these same variants by switching which server name is placed first

For each test, query all 10 queries related to the corresponding and record the percentage of times the LLM selected each server

Control variable: The actual underlying servers (regardless of name) are still in the order Competitor 1,2,3,4,5 for every experiment.

Although omega being first has already been tested under gpt4o_asr_results, it is retested again for this experiment

Relative order:
- Omega first: 1. omega 2. sigma 3. zulu  4. beta  5. alpha  
- Sigma first: 1. sigma 2. zulu  3. beta  4. alpha 5. omega  
- Zulu first:  1. zulu  2. beta  3. alpha 4. omega 5. sigma  
- Beta first:  1. beta  2. alpha 3. omega 4. sigma 5. zulu   
- Alpha first: 1. alpha 2. omega 3. sigma 4. zulu  5. beta 
- mega is placed in the same position as it originally was in gpt4o_asr_results

Interpretation of results: 
If a server name is consistently chosen, regardless of whether it is in the first slot or not, then the name is a factor in LLM selection
If a server name is not consistently chosen AND the first server is still consistently chosen, must test whether the position of the server or the tool description is the main factor

Randomly selected variants to test:
- Randomly select 2 "0(*)" results from each server type to test
- Weather: 12 results
    - 2 Randomly selected numbers between 1-12: 5, 11
    - Correspond to (respectively): GAPMA Em middle bottom, GAPMA Su middle bottom
- Time: 14 results
    - 2 Randomly selected numbers between 1-14: 14, 6
    - Correspond to (respectively): GAPMA Su last, GAPMA Em middle top
- Installer: 6 results
    - 2 Randomly selected numbers between 1-7: 1, 2
    - Correspond to (respectively): GAPMA Au last, GAPMA Em middle top
- HotNews: 7 results
    - 2 Randomly selected numbers between 1-7: 3, 2
    - Correspond to (respectively): GAPMA Au middle top, DPMA Best Name last
- Fetch: 15 results
    - 2 Randomly selected numbers between 1-15: 8, 12
    - Correspond to (respectively): GAPMA Em middle bottom, GAPMA Ex last
- Crypto: 13 results
    - 2 Randomly selected numbers between 1-13: 11, 13
    - Correspond to (respectively): GAPMA Su middle top, GAPMA Su last
- Markdown: 11 results
    - 2 Randomly selected numbers between 1-11: 5, 1
    - Correspond to (respectively): GAPMA Em middle top, DPMA Best Name middle top
- Search: 14 results
    - 2 Randomly selected numbers between 1-14: 3, 13
    - Correspond to (respectively): GAPMA Au middle top, GAPMA Su middle bottom

Conclusion:
The name of the servers is not a factor in LLM tool selection. 
More tests must be done to determine whether the main factor is the competitor's tool description or other (assumption: the server order).


Potential issues with setup:
1. Should I be using competitor 1 for every server when testing? Or is maintaining fixed order okay
2. Do I need to randomize the order of the servers that are not first (in case of fixed sequence biasing)?
3. Should I be including mega (the malicious server) in the experiment?
