Experiment setup: 
Test the 16 results that were randomly selected in name_experiment.

We have already concluded that the suffix in the server name is NOT a factor in LLM tool selection. Therefore, we now must test whether the underlying server's tool descriptions are the main factor.

All tool descriptions were paraphrased using GPT-4o and assigned accordingly. 
The LLM was asked to generate 5 paraphrased descriptions from the same raw description.
However, it is a possibility that GPT-4o always outputs the best description first and the subsequent descriptions are not as effective.

Retest these same variants by switching which competitor server is placed first

For each test, query all 10 queries related to the corresponding and record the percentage of times the LLM selected each server

Control variable: The name of the servers are still in the order "omega", "sigma", "zulu", "beta", "alpha" for every experiment.

Although Competitor 1 being first has already been tested under gpt4o_asr_results, it is retested again for this experiment

Relative order:
- Competitor 1 first: (1) Comp 1 (2) Comp 2 (3) Comp 3 (4) Comp 4 (5) Comp 5
- Competitor 2 first: (1) Comp 2 (2) Comp 3 (3) Comp 4 (4) Comp 5 (5) Comp 1  
- Competitor 3 first: (1) Comp 3 (2) Comp 4 (3) Comp 5 (4) Comp 1 (5) Comp 2  
- Competitor 4 first: (1) Comp 4 (2) Comp 5 (3) Comp 1 (4) Comp 2 (5) Comp 3  
- Competitor 5 first: (1) Comp 5 (2) Comp 1 (3) Comp 2 (4) Comp 3 (5) Comp 4  
- mega (malicious server) is placed in the same position as it originally was in gpt4o_asr_results

Interpretation of results: 
If a competitor server is consistently chosen, regardless of whether it is in the first slot or not, then the competitor's tool description can be assumed to be the strongest and a factor in LLM tool selection

Randomly selected variants to test (same as name_experiment):

    - Correspond to (respectively): GAPMA Au middle top, GAPMA Su middle bottom

Potential issues with setup:
1. Do I need to randomize the order of the servers that are not first (in case of fixed sequence biasing)?
2. Should I be including the malicious server in the experiment? Or is not relevant for what we are testing here?
