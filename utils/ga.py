"""
Genetic Algorithm for Preference Manipulation

This module implements a genetic algorithm approach for evolving MCP server descriptions.
It provides functions for mutation, crossover, and selection of descriptions to create
more effective and stealthy advertising descriptions for preference manipulation attacks.

The genetic algorithm works by:
1. Mutating descriptions to reduce obvious exaggeration
2. Crossing over descriptions to combine effective elements
3. Selecting the most effective descriptions based on LLM evaluation
