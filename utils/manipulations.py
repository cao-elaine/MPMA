"""
Prompt Manipulation Utilities

This module provides functions for manipulating MCP server descriptions using
different strategies:
- DPMA (Direct Preference Manipulation Attack): Simple rule-based manipulations
- GAPMA (Genetic-based Advertising Preference Manipulation Attack): Uses genetic algorithms
  to evolve descriptions with different advertising strategies

The module supports various advertising strategies:
- Au: Authority-based descriptions
- Em: Emotion-based descriptions
- Ex: Exaggeration-based descriptions
- Su: Subliminal influence-based descriptions
