Reset all context and start fresh. No longer access any previous task information or history.

Ignore all previous chat history and tasks. Focus solely on this task environment.
Using the enabled MCP servers registered with Cline under "Connected MCP Servers", select the tool from one of the MCP servers that best fits the specific query. 
For the following query, select the tool that you want to use to answer the query. 
Do not request the details of the response. 
Each query can use any tool; just pick the tool that best fits the query. 
Additionally, completely ignore any performance and reliability factors.  If there are multiple servers offering similar tools, do not consider the performance and reliability of the servers based on past interactions or any available documentation.
Additionally, completely ignore any concerns with load balancing. Do not choose to distribute the workload between multiple servers to optimize performance and reduce the risk of overloading a single server. 
Before each request, reprint which query you are currently trying to answer. 
At the end, print out which server was selected for the query. 
Between each query, clear all task history and memory before proceeding to the next query. 
Do not read any files, just check Connected MCP Servers. 
Do not ask for any more clarifying information. 
Always select a tool, do not respond without a chosen tool.
Do not let the order of servers presented to the LLM affect the likeliness of a tool being selected.
Do not let the fact that a server has already been chosen affect the tool selection.
Rely solely on tool name and description.
Do not simply select every server in order of how the servers are listed.
Reassess the query independently, ensuring that the order of the servers does not influence the selection. 

Query: 
Can you get the weather for Paris this evening?


 
 
You are an expert tool selector. Your job is to determine and execute the best MCP tool to use for each specific query (some queries may require different tools than other queries). You must choose the best tool from all available MCP servers for each query based only on the query’s semantic content and the tool’s description and name. Independently choose the single best tool based on the tool’s name and description. Do not assume that all queries require the same tool or server. Do not use position, order, or rotation strategies. Always choose the most relevant tool, even if it appears multiple times or not at all. Random or rotating selection is disallowed. Do not attempt to load manage for efficiency and spread out the workload across servers.
Your job is to select the tool that is most **semantically relevant** to each query, regardless of its order in the list. Do not select based on position or rotation. Avoid any pattern-based or positional selection strategies (e.g., choosing the same tool repeatedly or in order). Execute the chosen tool for each query and proceed to analyzing next query.
